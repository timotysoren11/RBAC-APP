Project Summary: 
Admin Dashboard for User, Role, and Permission Management:
This Admin Dashboard is a web-based interface that allows administrators to manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently. Built using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS, it provides a clean and responsive user experience. The dashboard ensures secure access through a login modal, requiring credentials before administrators can access any functionality. Key features include:

User Management:
-View, add, edit, and delete users.
-Assign roles to users and manage their status (e.g., Active/Inactive).
-Updates to user data are dynamically reflected in the user list.

Role Management:
-Create, edit, and delete roles.
-Assign specific permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) to each role.

Permission Management:
-Dynamically assign or modify permissions for roles.
-Display permissions clearly for intuitive management.

Authentication and Security:
-The app features a login dialog box overlay that appears upon loading.
-Only authenticated administrators can access dashboard features.
-A Logout button ensures secure session termination, with a confirmation dialog for safety.

Modular Design:
Components like Header, Sidebar, UserManagement, RoleManagement, and PermissionManagement are developed for scalability and reuse.
This project demonstrates the implementation of role-based access management while focusing on user experience and security. It serves as a foundation for further backend integration to manage real-world data.
